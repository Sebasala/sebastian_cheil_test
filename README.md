# Sebastian Cheil Test 2

I used the react express starter pack by Brad Traversy as an starting point for this project to run server and client at the same time and with a single comand, avoiding the js CORS error while fetching the api on the same origin.

So far the server have to end points, one to show first 9 hotels on the JSON file and one to filter hotels by stars.

The front end render the hotels with stars on state.starsFilter but dont have any control to let the user filter hotels yet.

Following youll find instructions on how to install and run the project.

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
